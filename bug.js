This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native, and the state update function is called with a value that is different from the previous state value, but React Native doesn't re-render the component because of a mismatch in the object reference. This usually happens when you're updating an object or an array. For example, if you have a state variable that is an object, such as `useState({ count: 0 })`, and you update the state like this: `setMyState({...myState, count: myState.count + 1})`, React Native might not trigger a re-render because it's still the same object reference.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [myState, setMyState] = useState({ count: 0 });

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setMyState({ ...myState, count: myState.count + 1 }); // This might not re-render
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{myState.count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
